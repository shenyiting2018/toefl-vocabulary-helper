English (GRE/TOEFL) Vocabulary Builder
================================
Welcome! This is a vocabulary builder written by Yiting Shen. 
When I prepared for the GRE/TOEFL tests (English-based graduate program entrance exam), I found it difficult to find a website or mobile application that supports all my needs to build my English vocabulary. Then I decided to build my own website.
