English (GRE/TOEFL) Vocabulary Builder with Root Words
================================
Welcome! This is a Vocabulary Builder written by Yiting Shen. 

As a non-native English speaker, vocabulary is the first step and most difficult step to master this language. I've tried different approaches to build up my vocabulary and none of them works efficiently, until one day I found the roots-word approach. 

From this [article](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/grow-your-vocabulary-by-learning-root-words/4113426.html)

>A root can be any part of a word that carries meaning: the beginning, middle or end. Prefixes, bases, and suffixes are types of roots. The prefix appears at the beginning of a word, the base in the middle and the suffix at the end.

For example: 
`component` has two root words: `com`(together) and `po`(put) with is a mutation of `pos`.   
`predecessor` has three root words: `pre`(before), `de`(going down), `cess`(walk)

To apply for a U.S graduate school, two tests need to be taken: GRE and TOEFL. Together these two tests require more 10k advanced level vocabulary. This is the most painful part for non-English speakers. I found it difficult to find a website or mobile application that well supports memorizing vocabulary via roots word. Then I decided to build my own website.
